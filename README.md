# Project Report Abstract

This project aims to evaluate the performance of Model Predictive Controller against a reference Linear Quadratic Regulator in the context of fixed-wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles operations under system uncertainty and actuator fault. The study was conducted through implementing the controllers in a custom simulation framework for fixed-wing UAV autonomous GNC to simulate the system tracking a reference airspeed, altitude, and heading. 
A Kalman Filter was added to the closed-loop control to provide the autopilot with an optimal estimation of states under noise and wind. The performance of the individual controllers and the estimator were evaluated. In the case of throttle or elevator failure, separate controllers were designed to stabilize the UAV's flight. The performance of each controller was compared with respect to the glide angle of the aircraft after the fault occurred. 
Each controllerâ€™s computational efficiency was also evaluated and considered. The findings of this report show that the Model Predictive Control scheme with a small control horizon provides minimal to no performance advantages over the Linear Quadratic Regulator under uncertainty and fault despite having a much greater computational cost. These findings will provide insights into the strengths and limitations of the these types of controllers, facilitating future UAV developments and applications.
